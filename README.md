# Deep learning
After completing the machine learning specialization on deeplearning.ai, I figured it would be good to implement all the algorithms from scratch.

Depending on the complexity of the algorithm, the abstraction used will vary.

# Algorithms
## Supervised Learning
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistical Regression
3. Multi-layer Perceptron (MCP)
4. Decision Trees
## Unsupervised Learning
1. Clustering (K-means)
2. Anomaly Detection
3. Collaborative Filtering
4. Content-based Filtering
5. Reinforcement Learning
